# How to run

* Copy or link the Screw directory as a subdirectory of this one.
* Run run_farlik_pipeline.sh


* Note: we are having some trouble with Docker hashtags and quay.io, so this may or may not work. If you can get the latest build of the Docker image, with the latest Screw code contained within, it should run.

Describing an assay and a bioinformatic method to analyze collections of single-cell methylomes to infer cell-state dynamics. They studied epigenomic cell-state dynamics in three in vitro models of cellular differentiation and pluripotency, observing specific patterns of epigenome remodeling as well as cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Methods can be used to study embryonic development, stem cell differentiation, and cancer as well as generation of composite methylomes accounting for cell-to-cell heterogeneity in complex tissue samples.
