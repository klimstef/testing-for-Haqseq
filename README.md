# How to run

* Copy or link the Screw directory as a subdirectory of this one.
* Run run_farlik_pipeline.sh


* Note: we are having some trouble with Docker hashtags and quay.io, so this may or may not work. If you can get the latest build of the Docker image, with the latest Screw code contained within, it should run.
